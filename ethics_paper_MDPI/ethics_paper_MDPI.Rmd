Problem setup:

- In US, big challenge w/ information privacy:

1. the internet of things (https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=3622&context=bclr)

2. data commodification -- data as capital (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiD8NynpIXwAhWnAZ0JHS2aDpsQFjACegQIAhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.monash.edu%2Ffiles%2F303893944%2F303893762_oa.pdf&usg=AOvVaw09nsGbgbaIQ7dJa-sP-ITn) (https://columbialawreview.org/content/paying-for-privacy-and-the-personal-data-economy/)

3. Dangers:

  - data breaches + data used against you (financial info, identity theft, health data particularly damaging)
  - interest targeting a very powerful tool to cause dangerous psychological shifts (see FB scandal)
  - tools to enable exclusion (see sexual orientation scanner, ER triage algorithms)
  - bias

4. Current protections in us:
  https://columbialawreview.org/content/paying-for-privacy-and-the-personal-data-economy/
  https://iclg.com/practice-areas/data-protection-laws-and-regulations/usa
  https://www.cfr.org/report/reforming-us-approach-data-protection

6. What other countries have done that we haven't

- GDPR in EU https://gdpr-info.eu
- South Korea https://iapp.org/news/a/gdpr-matchup-south-koreas-personal-information-protection-act/ ,  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2904896
- Chile https://cms.law/en/int/expert-guides/cms-expert-guide-to-data-protection-and-cyber-security-laws/chile https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/look-back-and-ahead-data-protection-latin-america-and-spain 


  
5. Why it's hard for us to do the same

- We don't currently have an agency that could be focused on managing data protection --- closest is FTC but they don't have oversight power of lots of private companies
- Powerful tech lobby at federal level has huge leverage on voting
- All the states are so different from one another so state-only laws would be a challenging patchwork if not controlled
- potentially not enough public support. In US, we're just used to our data being used all the time. However, concern does seem to be growing.

It COULD work though --- look at HIPAA!! It is super strict in the healthcare industry, and goes pretty smoothly. tech companies have adapted to make HIPAA compliant software

7. What we should do

DON'T TRY TO CREATE WHOLE PRIVACY LAW --- will not work in the current climate. No way to enforce and considerably too big of a jump. Work in smaller steps w/ less punishment

- Create a data protection agency
- focus on prevention, not monetary punishment (better incentives for companies)
- widen the definition of what can count as a data-privacy related harm to afford more opportunities to individuals to take problems to court as well as what is considered sensitive data
https://www.cfr.org/report/reforming-us-approach-data-protection
- On the statewide level, if wanting to create laws, do so with an eye for making them consistent. Once a majority of states have them, more pressure for federal change
- Eventually do need federal law. Should attempt to get both Republican and Democratic support which apparently already exists (https://www.theregreview.org/2021/03/13/saturday-seminar-how-should-united-states-protect-data/)
