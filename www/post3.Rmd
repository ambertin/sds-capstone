title: "'Objective' Data Are Not Treated As Such"

One of the quotes from Chapter 2 of *Data Feminism* that really struck me was the following:

> "Those in positions of power accept anecdotal evidence from those like themselves, but demand endless statistics from minoritized groups."

As someone in a position of relative power in the world—a white, upper-middle class, highly educated woman with many positive future prospects, and someone whom biased data science is unlikely to negatively effect—my privilege allowed me to be blinded to this idea. I recognized that algorithms themselves contained bias, resulting in unfair and unequal outcomes, but not that the standards for data-based evidence were so unequal. I had simply assumed—naively—that a "factual" form of evidence such as data would carry equal weight no matter the situation in which it was applied. Of course, this is entirely wrong.

It makes me really wonder just how many poor people, people of color, or other minorities have been severely harmed by unfairly high data standards. 

Would the *McCleskey v. Kemp* Supreme Court case I discussed in my first post have turned out differently if McCleskey were white instead of black? Would the court, then, have been more receptive to the use of statistical analyses as evidence for death penalty discrimination? 

Thinking back through history, now, I clearly see a pattern. Cases that would be un-winnable if the petitioner were a minority become easy to win if you flip them on their heads and claim that a majority member has been discriminated against! Just look at one of Ruth Bader Ginsberg's most famous cases: *Charles E. Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*. Ginsberg had been trying to argue sex-based discrimination against women for *years*, but it was not until she picked up this case, which involved discrimination against a man (who would not be given a tax deduction for claiming he was a caregiver, even though women could gain that deduction, since the IRS did not believe men could be full time caregivers) that she was able to win. Only by showing evidence of discrimination against a majority member could she convince a court of the problem; no matter how good her case, if it involved a woman as the object of discrimination, it was un-winnable.

This is just one example, but it is certainly not an isolated incident. With a problem so pervasive, I wonder, really what can be done to address it? It seems that perhaps the only solution, really, is systemic change. Majority members cannot be the only ones with the power to make decisions; our highest courts, political leaders, and others in positions of power must be made up of people from all backgrounds and all walks of life. Only then, do I think that this unfair standard could go away.
