I'm Audrey and I'm a senior Data Science Major / Public Policy minor at Smith College!

I've had a longstanding interest in issues involving ethical data use. I've studied the potential impacts of universal translation tools, considered the dangers of predictive policing tools, and looked into potential policy solutions for combatting facial recognition as a tool for United States border control. 

I've even built a website with a fellow Smith student which contains resources for those looking to find more information about bias and inequality in the data science world! (https://hmsnell.github.io/DataSci-ResourcesForChange/).

I hope you find something interesting on this blog! Hopefully, it should be covering a variety of aspects of data ethics, meaning there's something for everyone!
