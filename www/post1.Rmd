title: "Christine Darden's Career May Not Have Been Easy, But She Was Still Lucky"
---

In the introduction to *Data Feminism*, the authors detail the story of human computer Christine Darden, who played an incredibly important role in ensuring the safe travel and return of several major NASA missions. Although she was highly qualified for her position, and skilled enough to be promoted far beyond the role of computer, Darden faced many challenges in her time at NASA---finding herself left to stagnate in her role, while her male counterparts were constantly promoted to positions for which she was equally qualified. That is, until a colleague of hers, Gloria Champine, presented a data visualization to Darden's boss which illustrated the fact that the organization's promotion practices were biased in favor of men. The data proved a point which could not be refuted, her boss gave in, and Darden received a well-deserved raise.

Although Christine Darden did not have an easy career by any means, her story still stuck out to me as one of the positive ones. She was lucky---with the right colleagues and support at the right time, she was able to use data to get what she wanted and deserved. 

While data can be incredibly powerful as potential forces for positive change, most of what I have read and studied indicates that positive outcomes are not all that common. Rather, data are regularly used to *perpetuate* systems of oppression---or, in some cases, considered far too inadequate inadequate evidence to prove discrimination, leaving those in situations like Darden's with few avenues for achieving the change they desire.

Darden's case was a very fortunate one. She was able to use data showing a systemic problem--inequity across genders in the promotion process at NASA--as evidence that she, personally, was being discriminated against, which resulted in her gaining her desired end goal: a promotion. 

A feat such as Darden's has historically been incredibly difficult---at times next to impossible. This is due to the fact that the lawmakers and elite of the United States have, on multiple occasions, considered data to be an inadequate tool in proving individualized discrimination.

Perhaps the most famous instance involving this issue is the United States Supreme Court case  *McCleskey v. Kemp* (1987). This case revolved around the issue of the death penalty, with the petitioner (Warren McCleskey) arguing that he was racially discriminated against in the receipt of his death sentence. 

As evidence to demonstrate his point, McCleskey and his lawyers testified about a statistical study on the racial factors in death penalty sentencing, which indicated clear disparities in death penalty imposition based on the race of both the accused murderer and their victim(s).

Although the evidence strongly demonstrated systematic bias, the court ruled that the statistics were insufficient proof: although they illustrated a systematic problem of discrimination, they did not prove that the defendant himself---specifically---was discriminated against. As a result, his death sentence stood.

This case was pivotal in the history of the death penalty, but also had implications for the use of data all across the legal world. The Supreme Court, by declaring the data inadequate, set a precedent that weakened its strength as a tool to protect those facing discrimination. This case, which occurred a little over three decades ago, has yet to be overturned in a major way.

This case happened in the late 1980s, a time when the United States was much more progressive than it had historically been, yet still the court did not consider data-based evidence to be viable proof of discrimination. Things were likely even worse before this time period and do not seem to have changed for the better since then.


If the highest court in the United States does not value data as evidence of discrimination, it begins to beg the question of how we will ever be able to use data to their full positive potential. Christine Darden was able to do so, but she was lucky and had the support of colleagues who were convinced by her evidence. Not everyone is so fortunate. It is wonderful to see positive change---such as the publishing of this book and and an increase in discussions around ethics and bias in data use---but unless things are recognized as a problem nationwide, and the legal system provides full support, it is hard to visualize data reaching their maximum positive potential.
