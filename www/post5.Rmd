In a few months I'll be graduating and heading off into the real world as a data scientist. Before I came to college, I used to think that this title just meant that I'd be a cool data nerd who makes fun visualizations and answers interesting questions, but my studies into data ethics have made it clear that in reality, data science is so much more than that. 

As talked about in Ch 5 of *Data Feminism*, society has this belief of data scientists as being like unicorns---people who can do it all: design and conduct experiments, collect and engineer data, analyze it, visualize it, and communicate about it effectively. As someone who is about to go out into the real world and hold a job with the title of "Data Scientist" in it, this makes me feel so overwhelmed! What other job has such high and complex societal expectations on it, other than, say, something like the President of the United States? Realistically, how many people can *really* be skilled at all of those different things? It's next to impossible.

This sort of expectation as data scientists as those who can do it all feels dangerous, mostly because people don't understand that this is not something reasonable to ask of anyone! As *Data Feminism* describes, data scientists aren't unicorns---they're just one chain in the list of many people who help make an analysis possible, from those who conduct interviews at the local level, to those who choose which data to collect, to those who format it for analysis, and so on. But nobody realizes this---they see data scientists as the faces of this analysis process, since they typically are responsible for the visualization aspect---and thus hold them responsible for the whole thing.

This both undermines those who are incredibly important to the process, but unseen, *and* the data scientists who have impossible expectations placed on them.

Although I'm confident in my skills, I know there is simply no way I can be that true, ideal unicorn and do it all. There is not enough time in the day to learn and execute all those steps, and a work-life balance is incredibly important to me. But the more that society idealizes this image of the data scientist, the more likely it is that I'll be expected to be this type of person---especially if I work for a company or organization who is new to data science and does not understand the full complexity and challenge that data analysis can bring. 

Dispelling the unicorn notion would be incredibly helpful to mitigating these issues, but the more I read *Data Feminism*, the more it becomes clear how challenging of a task that really is! Dismantling "unicornism" would require changing the public perception of data science to make clear just how many people are truly involved---to make visible the invisible labor that plays such an important role in this industry. But this task feels almost impossible. With poor documentation, how can you do any more than just analyze the data for what you think it is? How can you uncover who made it and the conditions in which it was created? I really don't know the answer, and I doubt a lot of people do.
